Customers vs Subscribers in bikesharing
# Analysis
As seen, there is an abundance of data from previous implentation of this system that can be refined to make a more efficient business model. Some key takeaways for this analysis include:
- Males rent 3x as much as females, in general.
- The busiest time for bikesharing is from 5-7 pm.
- Rides typically last less than 20 minutes.
- Males and Females tend to take a similar amount of time riding bikes.
- Males and Females also tend to follow a similar pattern of what days they ride as well as when.
- Most bike sharing users come from subscribers as opposed to customers.  
From these points possible conclusions/improvements to be drawn:
- Can increase availability by advertising/accomodating for females
- Increase bike availability from 5-7 pm, especially on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday.
- Increase attrativeness of customers, whilst maintaining outlook for subscribers.
Finally, two additional visualizations that could create more insight:
- Height chart of various users, to provide more equipment/bikes catered towards various heights
